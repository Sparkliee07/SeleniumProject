  Test NG advance version of junit 
  its a seperate libary we have to add dependency
  we have to put @test in class method upper 
  structure of xml file 
 <suite is like complete set of group of test cases when we want to run a complete regression that is called suite 
 <test is like multiple tests each individual model 
 <classess refer to model of classess 
 <method is like which ever methods wnant to execute in present in classes 
 
 @Before suite - StartReport / Connection to cloud -> test cases executed 
   @Before test -> data base connection for that module 
     @Before class -> To create test cases in report 
       @Before method  -> Login
         @Test 
       @After Method -> Close the browser 
     @After class Stop test case in report
   @After Test -> close db connection
 @After Suite -> stop repoet
 
 Annotations help to control the flow of execution 
 @Parameters -> for the usuage of testng parameter upside of method 
 @Parameters({"url","username","password"})
 parameter order doesn't matter in xml file but matter in code 
 its mainly used for static info its used across all your tets cases 
 information which is common foll all your test cass you have to use parameter 
 @Optional if we don't see the parameter value by default it will take this
