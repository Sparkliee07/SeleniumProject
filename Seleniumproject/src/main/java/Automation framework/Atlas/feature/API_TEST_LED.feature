Feature: User String Functionality

  Scenario: Basic User String Set and Get Test
    Given the test site is initialized
    When I set the user string to "hello"
    And I wait for 3 seconds
    And I retrieve the user string
    Then the retrieved user string should be "hello"
    And no exceptions should occur
    And proper logging of comparison results should be present
    And the test site is torn down

  Scenario: Exception Handling for GetUserString
    Given the test site is initialized
    When I retrieve the user string without setting it
    Then the method should handle uninitialized user strings gracefully without crashes or unhandled errors
    And the test site is torn down

  Scenario: Exception Handling for SetUserString
    Given the test site is initialized
    When I set the user string to a null or empty value
    Then the method should handle null or invalid inputs gracefully without crashes or unhandled errors
    And the test site is torn down

  Scenario: Stress Testing for Get and Set User String
    Given the test site is initialized
    When I set and retrieve the user string "test123" 1000 times
    Then the retrieved user string should match the input in all iterations
    And the methods should handle repeated operations without degradation or errors
    And the test site is torn down

  Scenario: Test Site Setup and Teardown
    Given I initialize the test site
    Then the test site should be set up correctly
    When I tear down the test site
    Then no residual configurations should remain
    And no errors or exceptions should occur during setup or teardown
